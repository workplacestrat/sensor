The 8th floor ""kitchen"" is also an efficiency experts nightmare. Good luck finding plates. When the air isnt running in the office or the early morning or late evening there is a smell of mildew. Conference rooms on 8th floor are weak. Wires that arent long enough, nothing wireless. "

"Communications and Marketing","Administrative","Born 1981-1990","1-2 years","Open workstation with low or no panels","Detractor",75,"needstobechanged","I've had four different supervisors in less than 2 years and the only one who exuded awesome leadership skills and wasn't incompetent, insufficient or more tired mid-level manager than leader, was a 24-year-old (at the time) Marketing Specialist who was promoted from Graphic Designer within a year of me being hired. I think that's telling that of how management is SO far removed from the day-to-day that they hired just who they liked and not who could do the job from day one.    Management routinely puts the needs of the brokers ahead of its own people and encourages us to flex our time instead of getting paid the overtime that is due. When I first got here, there wasn't an obvious restriction on working from home. I honestly couldn't tell you because my first manager didn't make waves. My second supervisor, the 24-year-old, didn't care what we did unless we got our work done, which is the typical attitude most of the team leaders have. My third supervisor was actually my boss, in a director role, who had to step in when my supervisor quit because he got hired at competitor and CBRE wouldn't match it nor promote him to manager even though he was doing the job basically since I got there. My fourth supervisor was hired after the department changed leadership and transitioned my old boss into a new role more his speed.     I still can't understand to this day why they hired a manager with no prior managerial experience, managing designers with no creative experience or at least an awareness of design or the industry. She has the bare minimum of what was required to run the department effectively and she's visibly being coached by my new boss, when not one of my previous supervisors got or needed that type of hands-on training.    At this point, I've lost all confidence in CBRE knowing their departments enough to hire, let alone cultivate the right talent. It's a revolving door out here. The 10-person team that I worked with daily is down to 7 and I'm the most senior person on the team if we're talking who's been there the longest. That's sad, since I only got this job because the senior designer went on maternity leave and decided not to come back.     It's already bad enough that they have inconsistent on-boarding procedures, HR is remote and out of the way in Dallas (and they're basically toothless anyway, if you don't have issue that's automatically warrants HR intervention, plus they rather side with management than advocate for employees) and there's no design leadership anywhere to be found to support all the designers and creative CSCs that CBRE runs into ground. The way they've structured the Marketing department is completely opposite of how the design industry functions in the marketplace. We're treated like a vanity service and not as the business imperative that design is, legitimizing and breeding credibility. Thus, out of all things that SHOULD change, yet won't... is that.    Because CBRE doesn't monetize the Business Development department, we operate on way smaller budgets than other teams get. Offering marketing services to brokers for free basically gives them license to treat us like second-class citizens, restricting how we get overtime and limiting our 2 work from home days to a case-by-case basis, while other teams get more freedom to take care of familial & personal obligations and aren't treated like wayward children who's presence is mandatory in order to give the perception that we're always available when a broker requires us, even though the most of the office is empties out before 5:00pm and on Fridays. We have to stay in the office until 5:30 or 6:00 for no other reason but on the off chance a broker should put in a last-minute request.     And last but not least, I abhor that I'm working at the same hourly rate that I started at in NYC seven years ago because CBRE pays their designers under the competitive rate. Which means that we can't hire the people we truly need unless they're in their early career and don't care than only nonprofits pay worse than us--a market leader. Not only that, it limits the type of freelancers we hire too because the rate is so low. We end up hoping there are desperate sufficient designers that just need the work than settling for someone who has no sense of what good corporate design looks like.  "

Pictures of team accomplishments, a family picture, a reminder of why we work so hard...these things are all important.  I do not see the setup and clean up of any such items as realistic on a day to day basis.  Again, I understand the gained efficiencies, but fear that this will come at a sacrifice to creating a sense of place, which is incredibly important given the amount of time we spend in the office.

I get it... their lease isn't up until 2019 or 2020. But honestly, with all the brokers they have at their disposal, couldn't they do a feasibility study to make that more of a priority. I've worked on countless projects with brokers giving different scenario options, informing their clients of and selling them on keeping up with the times and creating the workspaces that promote productivity and increase employee retention.

"Project Management","Managing Director/Sr Managing Director","Born before 1964","3-5 years","A private office","Detractor",125,"othercomments","The workspace should have a variety of work settings from private, to open, individual to collaborative. Acoustics in ALL spaces needs to be significantly improved. Our current space (at least on level 9 does allow for natural light into the space. Additional private, semi-private and open collaboration spaces embedded in the general work areas should be considered in the new space. (instead they are relegated to the conference center and a few conference rooms. In a future office Centralizing conference and or socializations spaces in one area of the floor would be a mistake. These types of spaces should be spread out throughout the floor and easily accessible by employees.   There are no soft seating or open conferencing spaces for staff/team members to have impromptu meetings/discussions. I believe these types of spaces should be imbedded into the general office environment and not centralized. People find it inconvenient to walk to a conference center or in the case of Baltimore office 360 to the hearth. I work up there once or twice a week and frankly no one is ever using the space. That should tell you something. The current DC office space is basically a low panel cubical farm with perimeter offices. The new sit stand desks are good but they are arranged facing each other which is not a good solution from an acoustical standpoint and in effect is a variation of the one size fits all cubical farm. People talking on the phone are facing each other and this contributes to the acoustical problems. As far as different types of worksettings in the existing facility there are basically two (open and semi-private offices) The new office 360 program has reduced it to one. I am not sure that provides the best worksetting for the various job functions within the organization.   Audio Visual/Technology systems need to be significantly improved to incorporate current technology integration with IT systems, larger flat screens properly sized for the rooms, one touch AV controls, and seamless interface with or without a laptop. Flat screens at the workstations need to larger than what I have seen in the Baltimore 360 office. Larger screens are only incrementally more expensive and are worth the money (especially if you want to move to a paperless environment). Video conferencing is already being delivered to the desk top via Skype and the office environment needs to be designed to support it. The day of the desk phone is rapidly disappearing with Skype (or perhaps another technology) replacing them. The space needs to be designed to support these new technologies and ways of working.   The aesthetic of the existing space has stood the test of time in that it is not a ""trendy design"".  However, the space lacks CBRE branding and a variety of design elements and interesting materials. Our new space should tell the story of the company, its employees and its clients. It is a great way to convey the physical manifestation of the culture of the organization. I also think the entire space could have a more of a hotel feel which would allow for a more relaxed, collaborative and warmer environment. Right now, we have a really boring generic space and what I have seen of other Office 360 environments they are not much better.    "
